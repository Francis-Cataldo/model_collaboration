### General
Welcome to MoCo, where we execute model collaboration algorithms by writing a JSON config file. Config files look like:

```json
{
    "method": "api_prompt_routing", // the name under model_collaboration/method/ folder, names like <type>_<approach>.py
    "task": "agieval", // the name under data/ folder, see docs/eval_readme.md
    "task_type": "multiple_choice", // the eval type with the dataset, see docs/eval_readme.md
    "gpu_ids": [0,1,2], // a list of GPUs available on your machine
    "model_names": [
        "model_1_name",
        "model_2_name",
        "model_3_name"
    ], // a list of model identifiers, local or huggingface
    "hyperparameters": {
        "max_response_length": 512,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "batch_size": 8, // per GPU batch size
        // and then, method-specific hyperparameters listed in this doc
    }
}
```

We provide an example config for every model collaboration algorithm in `examples/`.

We then execute the specified collaboration in two ways. If you `git clone` this repo, make sure you are in the repo directory (the outer `model_collaboration/`) and:

```
python -m model_collaboration.main -c <path-to-config>.json
```

If you `pip install modelco`:

```
moco -c <path-to-config>.json -l ./
```

`-l` specifies where the logs will go.

`len(gpu_ids)` can be fewer than `len(model_names)` in most approaches. But please, try to use multiple GPUs and ideally `len(gpu_ids) == len(model_names)`. The code will automatically assign models to GPUs in a round-robin manner.

Try to use <10B LLMs or anything that could fit onto a single of your GPU. If you are trying to run collaboration with one of the model being too large to fit onto a single GPU: add `"big_model_mode": true` to `"hyperparameters"`: it will use all provided GPUs for a single model in rotation. This will only work for some approaches.

Reasoning LMs are supported! Please use much larger `"max_response_length"` to account for them: we will parse the text after `</think>` as the actual model output.

These are vibe implementations (and your future implementations can be): they are not meant to reproduce every single niche detail in any paper, just taking the core ideas and making them work in a reasonable way.

Without further ado, a complete list of all supported methods and configurations.

### API-level collaboration

#### API-level: Nudging
- file: `api_nudging.py`
- description: A training-free guided decoding method. During generation, if the base model is uncertain about the next token (top-1 prob < `gamma`), a (smaller) nudging model intervenes. The nudging model inserts nudging token(s) (often stylistic/discourse markers) to guide the base model’s generation. 
    - Implementation Details: The method ensures complete words are inserted (by splitting on spaces) to maintain coherence and support collaboration of models with different tokenizers. Generation stops when the current selected/active model (the model that is selected to generate the next token) emits an EOS token.
- related paper(s):
    - [Nudging: Inference-time Alignment of LLMs via Guided Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09300)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `gamma` (float, default 0.4): The uncertainty threshold. If the base model's top-1 probability is below this value, the nudging model takes over.
    - `base_model_id` (int, default 0): the index of the base model in `model_names`.
    - `nudging_model_id` (int, default 1): the index of the nudging model in `model_names`. (Requires `len(model_names) >= 2`). All the models that are not the base model are potential nudging models and will be used for searching if `search_nudging` is True.
    - `use_kv_cache` (bool, default False): Speed Optimization. If `True`, enables KV-caching. This significantly speeds up inference but may result in slight output variations (see KV-Cache Trade-offs below).
    - `search_gamma` (bool, default False): If `True`, performs a grid search over gamma values `[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]` using the dev set to find the optimal threshold.
    - `search_nudging` (bool, default False): If `True`, search over all potential nudging models (all the models in `model_names` excluding `base_model_id`) using the dev set to find the best nudging model.
- performance & usage note: 
    - Model Compatibility: 
        - Supports collaboration between different model families.
        - Tested combinations: `Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-8B` (base) + `Gemma-2-2b-it` (nudging) / `Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-8B-DPO` (nudging).
    - Inference speed 
        - Without KV-cache (Stateless): 
            - Behavior: Inference is compute-bound. The entire sequence is re-processed at every step.
            - Scaling: Speed scales linearly with sequence length and batch size. A batch of size $N$ will take roughly $N$ times longer than the longest sample in the batch.
            - Recommendation: Use small batch sizes or group samples by length to minimize wasted computation.
        - With KV-cache (Stateful):
            - Behavior: Memory-bound. Only the new token is processed at each step.
            - Speedup: Significantly faster for long sequences.
            - Benchmark: In tests on agieval_tiny (dev set), batch_size=8 with KV-cache was approximately 4x faster than batch_size=1 without KV-cache.
    - **KV-Cache Trade-offs (Read Carefully)**: Enabling `use_kv_cache=True` may produce slightly different outputs compared to the stateless version, particularly when models use different tokenizers.
        - Cause (Tokenization Fragmentation):
            - Without Cache: The system re-tokenizes the entire string at every step. The tokenizer can retrospectively merge tokens for optimality (e.g., merging "Einstein" + "'s" into a single token if the vocabulary supports it).
            - With Cache: Previous tokens are "locked" in the cache. The model sees the sequence as fragmented chunks (e.g., ["Einstein", "'", "s"]).
        - Cause (Precision): Minor numerical drift in `bfloat16` accumulations between the "Prefill" kernel (used in non-cached) and "Decoding" kernel (used in cached) can flip the selection of tokens with very similar probabilities.

#### API-level: Prompt Routing
- file: `api_prompt_routing.py`
- description: prompt an LLM to route among the candidate LLMs based on their descriptions. First, evaluate models on the dev set to determine who is best and use it for the routing. Then, given (model descriptions, query), this LLM decides which candidate model (including itself) should be selected. Finally, generation with the selected LLM for each query.
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `model_descriptions`: a list of strings describing each candidate model, in the same order as `model_names`.

#### API-level: Switch Generation
- file: `api_switch_generation.py`
- description: train (or use an existing LM) for switching among candidate LLMs (choosing different models to generate a patch of text before switching to another model). First, train a switcher LM based on rollouts evaluated by a reward model or use an existing switcher LM checkpoint. Then, switch generation among candidate LLMs based on the switcher LM's guidance.
- related paper(s):
    - [Don't Throw Away Your Pretrained Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09913)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `patch_size`, default 25: the number of tokens generated by each candidate model before switching.

- warning: cost could be high with `selector_model_name` not provided and a large `training_instance_num` and `rollout_per_instance`. Use a selector model or reduce the number of training instances and rollouts to save cost.
- note: try one `selector_model_name` among `bunsenfeng/PFA_switcher_1`, `bunsenfeng/PFA_switcher_2`, or any instruction following model. It is best not to specify a `selector_model_name` and just train one.

#### API-level: Trained Router
- file: `api_trained_router.py`
- description: train a router model to select among candidate LLMs. First, evaluate models on the dev set to determine who is best and use it for training the router.

    - [Language Model Cascades: Token-level uncertainty and beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10136)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `mode`, default `logit`: the mode for judge model confidence. Mode `logit` average token probability in response as model confidence. If confidence less than threshold, then deferred. Mode `just_ask` asks model to mention it is unconfident of its answer. If unconfident is in output, then deferred.
    - `percentage`, default 0.5: the percentage to select deferral threshold in `logit` mode. For each model except last model, calculate responses' scores on dev set. For each model, select its threshold as top `percentage` value in its dev set responses scores.

#### API-level: MentorCollab
- file: `api_mentor_collab.py`
- description: collaborative generation between a generator model (typically a small model) and a mentor model (typically a large reasoning model). During generation, both models operate in parallel. At each decision point, if the next predicted token differs between the two models, both generate a segment of text (patch). The method then decides which segment to follow either through: (1) "free" mode where the generator model itself judges which option is better, or (2) "train" mode where a trained MLP classifier predicts the better choice based on the generator's hidden states. This allows the base model to selectively incorporate guidance from the instruction-tuned mentor throughout generation.
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `decision_proportion`, default 25: percentage (0-100) of generation steps where the mentor is consulted. At other steps, the generator proceeds independently.
    - `patch_size`, default 16: number of tokens to generate in each segment when both models' predictions diverge.
    - `mode`, default "free": decision strategy. Options are "free" (generator self-judges) or "train" (use trained MLP classifier).
    - `task`, default "General": task type for loading the trained MLP model. Options are "Math" or "General" (only used in "train" mode).
    - `mlp_threshold`, default 0.5: decision threshold for the MLP classifier. Scores above this threshold choose the generator's segment, otherwise choose the mentor's (only used in "train" mode).
- notes:
    - **requires exactly 2 models and 2 GPUs**. The first model should be a base model (generator), and the second should be an instruction-tuned variant (mentor). In "train" mode, only specific model pairs are supported (see `MENTOR_COLLAB_TRAIN_SUPPORT_MODELS` in the code).
    - try `["meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B", "Qwen/Qwen3-14B"]` with `mode: "free"` first. For "train" mode, ensure the generator model is in the supported list. 
    - supported generator list for "train" mode: `["Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B", "Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base", "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "google/gemma-3-4b-it", "google/gemma-3-4b-pt"]`

#### API-level: CoLLM
- file: `api_collm.py`

The method uses a special deferral token (`<|defer|>`) whose probability indicates when the generator should seek help from the mentor. The training pipeline includes: (1) scoring data with both generator and mentor models, (2) creating deferral labels based on prediction differences, (3) two-phase training (deferral token initialization search + main training with marginal likelihood loss), and (4) collaborative inference where the trained model dynamically defers to the mentor during generation.
- related paper(s):

Lower values (e.g., 0.3) increase mentor usage and performance but cost more; higher values (e.g., 0.7) rely more on the generator
        - `deferral_strategy`, default `"defer"`: how to use the mentor model when deferring. Options:
            - `"defer"`: directly use the mentor's prediction (recommended)

        - `threshold_warmup_schedule`, default `"none"`: schedule for gradually lowering the deferral threshold during generation. Options:
            - `"none"`: use fixed threshold throughout
            - `"linear"`: linearly decrease from 1.0 to target threshold
            - `"cosine"`: use cosine schedule from 1.0 to target threshold
        - `threshold_warmup_steps`, default `15`: number of generation steps over which to apply threshold warmup (only used if warmup_schedule is not `"none"`)
    - **Generation parameters**:
        - `max_response_length`, default `2048`: maximum number of tokens to generate during inference
- workflow:
    1. **Initialize training data**: load dataset (default: MATH) and create training samples
    2. **Score with generator**: compute log probabilities using the small (generator) model
    3. **Score with mentor**: compute log probabilities using the large (mentor) model
    4. **Create deferral labels**: identify tokens where models disagree to mark deferral points
    5. **Phase 1 training**: search for optimal deferral token initialization (8000 steps)
    6. **Phase 2 training**: main training with marginal likelihood loss (2 epochs)
    7. **Inference**: collaborative generation where trained model defers to mentor
- requirements:
    - **Must use exactly 2 models**: `[generator_model, mentor_model]` where generator is smaller than mentor
    - **Training**: uses GPUs specified in `gpu_ids` (default: 4 GPUs)
    - **Inference**: uses GPUs specified in `gpu_ids` (requires 2 GPUs: one for generator, one for mentor)
    - **Must train before inference**: the method trains a model with deferral mechanism first, then uses it for inference
- outputs:
    - Training checkpoints saved to: `model_collaboration/logs/co-llm/{generator}-{mentor}/`
        - `model_checkpoints_init/`: Phase 1 checkpoints with deferral token initialization (`gperp_init.bin`)

        - `training_data.jsonl`: processed training data
    - Inference results saved to: `model_collaboration/logs/{task}_{base_model}_{ref_model}_collm_thresh{threshold}.json`
- warning:
    - Training can be compute-intensive depending on model sizes and `training_num`
    - Must complete training before running inference
    - If training was interrupted, delete the `model_checkpoints_final/` directory to retrain
    - To adjust training hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate), modify the `ModelTrainer` initialization in `run_method()`

A ranker LLM, optionally fine-tuned on dev pairwise preferences, compares candidates in an A/B fashion and aggregates wins to obtain a ranking. The top-k ranked candidates are then passed to a fuser LLM, optionally fine-tuned on dev with gold answers as supervision (when available), which generates a single fused answer that combines and refines the candidates. The same pipeline is applied on the test set for evaluation.
- related paper(s):
    - [LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and Generation Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08115)

    - `top_k`, default 3: how many top-ranked candidate answers to pass from the ranker to the fuser for each query. Will be clipped to `[1, len(model_names)]`.
    - `ranker_model_name`, default `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`: causal LM (HuggingFace name or local path) used as the ranker/judge model. Given `(question, candidates)`, this model is prompted to output scores for each candidate.
    - `ranker_gpu_id`, default `gpu_ids[0]`: GPU id to use for ranker inference.
    - `ranker_max_response_length`, default 128: maximum number of tokens to generate when the ranker LM is judging candidate answers (short outputs are sufficient).

    - `fuser_gpu_id`, default `gpu_ids[0]`: GPU id to use for fuser inference.
    - `fuser_max_response_length`, default `max_response_length` from the config: maximum number of tokens for the fused final answer.
    - `train_ranker_on_dev`, default False: whether to train the ranker on the dev set before evaluation on the test set. If True, the method will (1) generate candidate answers and scores on the dev split for all base models, (2) construct pairwise preference data based on dev scores, and (3) run SFT via `utils.distributed_sft.single_sft` to fine-tune `ranker_model_name`. At inference time, the ranker is always used in a pairwise A/B comparison mode with win-count aggregation. The trained checkpoint is saved under `model_collaboration/logs/text_llm_blender/ranker_model_<task>_<num_models>/` and used only for the current run.
    - `train_fuser_on_dev`, default False: whether to train the fuser on the dev set before evaluation on the test set. If True, the method will (1) use dev scores to select top-k candidate answers per example, (2) build fusion prompts with these candidates, (3) use the dataset gold dev answer as the supervision target when available (and fall back to the best-scoring candidate otherwise), and (4) run SFT via `utils.distributed_sft.single_sft` to fine-tune `fuser_model_name`.

    - `fuser_sft_learning_rate`, default 1e-5: learning rate for fuser SFT.
    - `fuser_sft_epoch`, default 3: number of training epochs for fuser SFT.
- note:
    - For pure zero-shot ranking and fusion, set `train_ranker_on_dev: false` and `train_fuser_on_dev: false`, and choose reasonable `ranker_model_name` / `fuser_model_name` (e.g., `ranker_model_name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"`, `fuser_model_name` as one of your candidate models).
    - To adapt the ranker and/or fuser to a specific task, set the corresponding `train_*_on_dev` flags to true. Intermediate SFT data and checkpoints will be saved under `model_collaboration/logs/text_llm_blender/` (e.g., `ranker_sft_<task>_<num_models>.jsonl`, `ranker_model_<task>_<num_models>/`). The final evaluation log remains `model_collaboration/logs/<task>_<num_models>_<score>_llm_blender.json` as usual.

- warning: this could be slow with large `population` and `max_iterations`. Reduce them to save computation.

#### Text-level: Majority Vote
- file: `text_majority_vote.py`
- description: Multiple LLMs independently generate answers for each query. The final answer is determined through majority voting, where the answer appearing most frequently among the models is selected as the output. When there is a tie, the tie-breaking strategy is used to select the final answer. This approach is applicable only to question types of "multiple_choice", "exact_match", or "f1_match".
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `tie`, default "random": the tie-breaking strategy. Options are "random" (arbitrarily select one of the tied answers) or "dev-based" (evaluate the models that vote for tied answers on the dev set, then use the answer from the best-performing model).

#### Text-level: SLM-MUX
- file: `text_slm_mux.py`
- description: A training-free, confidence-based router over a pool of (small) LMs. For each test question, every candidate model independently produces `samples_per_model` (k) samples; per-model confidence is the majority-vote consistency over its k extracted answers (`max_count / k`). The model with the highest confidence wins, and its majority answer is the final output. Ties on confidence are broken by validation accuracy on the dev set (the paper's default), or by model order / randomly. Unlike majority vote, which aggregates a single answer per model across models, SLM-MUX aggregates k samples *within* each model and then selects one model — which lets a single confident model override the rest. Applicable to "multiple_choice", "exact_match", and "f1_match" task types.
- related paper(s):
    - [SLM-MUX: Orchestrating Small Language Models for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05077)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `samples_per_model`, default 5: number of independent samples (k) drawn from each model per question. Higher k gives a more reliable confidence estimate at the cost of more inference.
    - `tie`, default "dev-based": tie-breaking when multiple models share the top confidence. Options are "dev-based" (evaluate every model once on the dev set and pick the one with the highest dev accuracy among the tied models — the paper's default), "model-order" (first model in `model_names` wins), or "random".
    - `seed`, default 42: random seed used for tie-breaking inside the consistency vote.
- note:
    - Sampling diversity matters: with `temperature` near 0 every sample collapses to the same answer and confidence saturates at 1.0 for every model. The paper uses `temperature=0.3`; values in `[0.3, 0.7]` work well.
    - Compute is roughly `samples_per_model x` what majority vote would take on the test set, plus one dev pass for tie-breaking.

#### Text-level: Structured Interaction
- file: `text_structure.py`
- description: multiple LLMs interact and update their responses according to a specific communication topology (graph structure). First, all models generate initial responses to the query. Then, over multiple rounds, each LLM receives the most recent responses of its "neighboring" models (defined by the structure) as context to update its own answer. Finally, the responses from the last round are evaluated. This allows simulating different information flow patterns like stars, trees, or chains.
- related paper(s):
    - [NetSafe: Exploring the Topological Safety of Multi-agent System](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.150/)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `num_rounds`, default 3: the number of response rounds for each model. The first round is when all model generate their initial responses individually, and then they update the responses in the following (`num_rounds` - 1) rounds.
    - `structure_type`, required: the topology of the communication graph. Options are `chain` (linear), `tree` (hierarchical), `star` (centralized), `circle` (ring), `complete` (all-to-all), or `other` (custom, where `structure_matrix` is expected).
    - `structure_matrix`, default None: an $N*N$ adjacency matrix $M$ (list of lists containing 0s and 1s). Required only if `structure_type` is `other`. $M_{ij}=1$ means Model $j$ sees responses by Model $i$ when updating its responses. The indices $i$ and $j$ correspond to the sequence of models defined in `model_names`.
- note: 
    - In each round, the model only sees the outputs from the immediately preceding round, not the entire conversation history.
    - The `structure_matrix` initialized for built-in options is bi-directional by default. However, when using `other`, the matrix does not have to be bi-directional and allows for custom uni-directional flows.
    - If a model does not have in-edges according to the `structure_matrix`, then it will keep its output from the last turn.
    - The models are evaluated on the dev set first without any interaction, where the best model will be selected to compute the final score on the test set after collaboration.

#### Text-level: Multiagent Finetuning
- file: `text_multiagent_finetuning.py`
- description: implement a multiagent finetuning loop where several copies of the same base model act as generation and critic agents. On the dev set, agents first run a multi-round debate: round 0 produces initial answers, later rounds let each agent see a summary of the other agents’ previous answers plus its own history and refine its response. For each iteration, we (1) majority-vote over the final extracted answers to get a consensus per question, (2) build per-agent generation datasets from examples where that agent’s *initial* answer agrees with the consensus, and (3) build per-agent critic datasets from full debate histories where the *final* answer agrees with the consensus, mixing “fixed my mistake” and “stayed correct” cases. Each generation and critic agent is then SFT-trained (LoRA) on its own dataset, and the process can repeat for multiple iterations. At test time, the finetuned agents run the same debate protocol and the final prediction is decided by majority vote over extracted answers.
- related paper(s):
    - [Multiagent Finetuning: Self Improvement with Diverse Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05707)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `iterations`, default 1: number of finetuning iterations (debate → build datasets → SFT).
    - `rounds`, default 2: total debate rounds (0 = initial generation, later rounds = critics).
    - `w`, default 0.5: relative weight of critic examples where the agent corrected an initially wrong answer versus examples where it stayed correct.
    - `training_ratio`, default 1.0: fraction of the dev split used to build the SFT datasets.
    - `sft_epochs`, default 1: number of epochs for LoRA SFT for each agent.
    - `sft_learning_rate`, default 1e-5: learning rate for SFT.
    - `sft_batch_size`, default 1: per-device batch size for SFT.
    - `sft_grad_accum`, default 16: gradient accumulation steps for SFT.
- notes:
    - Currently supports `task_type` in `["multiple_choice", "exact_match", "f1_match"]`, using the existing `data/eval.py` extraction logic for voting and scoring.
    - Use moderate-sized models and small `iterations` / `rounds` if compute is limited; each iteration runs a full multi-model debate plus SFT.

#### Text-level: Blackboard Multi-Agent System (BBMAS)
- file: `text_bbmas.py`
- description: multiple LLMs collaborate through a shared blackboard to solve problems iteratively. Agents take turns contributing to the blackboard by selecting from five action types: (1) propose a solving strategy, (2) execute a solution step, (3) verify existing content, (4) critique and refine existing work, or (5) terminate and finalize the solution. Each agent independently decides which action to take based on the current blackboard state through a two-step process: first selecting an action, then executing it. After collaboration concludes (when enough agents vote to terminate or max iterations is reached), all agents vote on the best final conclusion from the termination entries.
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `max_num_agents_to_act`, default 1: maximum number of agents that can act in each iteration.
    - `min_num_agents_to_stop`, default 1: minimum number of agents that must request termination to stop the collaboration.
    - `agent_idle_threshold`, default 6: if an agent hasn't acted for this many iterations, it is forced to act (overrides cooldown).
    - `max_iterations`, default 50: maximum number of collaboration iterations before forced termination.
    - `max_num_retries`, default 3: number of retry attempts when action selection or vote parsing fails.
- note: try with 2-3 diverse models. Reduce `max_iterations` (e.g., to 20) for faster testing. This method generates many LLM calls per test example (2 calls per agent action + voting calls), so it can be slow. Increase `max_num_agents_to_act` to 2-3 for more parallel collaboration.

#### Text-level: SPARTA
- file: `text_sparta.py`
- description: implement SPARTA alignment algorithm, an iterative competition-based training approach. In each iteration: (1) models compete pairwise on instructions, with opponents selected based on reputation scores or randomly; (2) other models (judges) dynamically score the competition responses (judges are models that didn't participate in each specific pair); (3) model ratings are updated based on judge scores using an Elo-like rating system; (4) preference pairs are generated from competitions; (5) DPO training is applied to improve models using the preference pairs. After all iterations, all adapters from all iterations are evaluated on the dev set, and the best one is selected for test evaluation.
- related paper(s):
    - [SPARTA ALIGNMENT: Collectively Aligning Multiple Language Models through Combat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04721)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `num_iterations`, default 3: number of Sparta iterations to run. Each iteration includes competition, judging, rating updates, and DPO training.
    - `current_iteration`, default 0: starting iteration number (for resuming from a previous run).
    - `num_instructions`, default 500: number of instructions to use for competition in each iteration.
    - `random_match_prob`, default 0.2: probability of random opponent selection (vs. reputation-based selection). With probability `random_match_prob`, a random opponent is chosen; otherwise, the opponent is selected from the top-K models with similar reputation scores.
    - `num_opponents`, default 3: number of top-K opponents to consider for matching based on reputation scores when not using random selection.
    - `judge_batch_size`, default 8: batch size for judge model generation.
    - `judge_rounds`, default 1: number of judging rounds per pair. Each round produces independent scores that are averaged.
    - `initial_k`, default 10.0: initial K value for rating updates. The K value controls how much model ratings can change after each competition (similar to the K-factor in Elo rating systems). Higher K means ratings change more quickly.
    - `min_k`, default 5.0: minimum K value (after decay). The K value decays over time to make rating updates more stable as training progresses.
    - `window_size`, default 10: window size for deviation calculation. Used to track the variance in rating changes over recent updates.
    - `min_deviation`, default 0.1: minimum deviation value for rating uncertainty estimation.
    - `epsilon`, default 0.01: small epsilon for numerical stability in rating calculations.
    - `decay_rate`, default 0.9: decay rate for K value. The K value is multiplied by `decay_rate` every `decay_steps` updates.
    - `decay_steps`, default 10: steps for K decay. After this many rating updates, the K value is decayed.
    - `scaling_factor`, default 20.0: scaling factor for rating updates. Divides the raw rating change to control the magnitude of updates.
    - `score_type`, default "normal": rating system type. Options: "normal" (standard Elo-like rating with equal weights for all judges), "dynamic" (dynamic-weighted, where model weights are computed based on previous iterations' performance, with lower-performing models getting reduced weights), or "static" (static-weighted, where weights are gradually assigned to more models over iterations based on their historical performance).
    - `freeze_ratings`, default false: if true, model ratings are not updated during the competition phase. Useful for testing or when you want to use fixed ratings.
    - `debug`, default false: if true, prints detailed rating update information (update count, K value, deviation changes) for debugging purposes.

#### Text-level: AggLM
- file: `text_agglm.py`
- description: trains an aggregator model to synthesize final solutions from multiple candidate solutions using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Given a problem and m candidate solutions from one or more LLMs, AggLM learns to review, reconcile, and combine them into a superior final answer. The method uses GRPO (Group-Relative Policy Optimization) with LoRA fine-tuning and carefully balances training on "hard" examples (where majority voting fails) and "easy" examples (where majority voting succeeds) to learn both minority-answer recovery and reliable aggregation.
- related paper(s):
    - [The Majority is not always right: RL training for solution aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06870)
- method-specific hyperparameters:
    - `agg_model`, default `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`: the base model to initialize the aggregator. Should ideally have the largest vocabulary size among the solution models. Can be a HuggingFace Hub ID or local path.
    - `agglm_log_path`, default `model_collaboration/logs/agglm`: directory to save training checkpoints, intermediate generation results, and trained LoRA adapters.
    - `reuse_log`, default `True`: whether to reuse existing generation and model weights. You might need to set this hyperparameter to `False` if error happens in the generation or training process
    - **Training hyperparameters:**
        - `learning_rate`, default 1e-4: learning rate for GRPO optimization.
        - `weight_decay`, default 1e-5: weight decay for regularization.
        - `lr_scheduler`, default `cosine`: learning rate scheduler type (e.g., `cosine`, `linear`).
        - `max_epochs`, default 1: number of training epochs.
        - `train_batch_size`, default 4: batch size for both GRPO training (per_device_train_batch_size and num_generations).
        - `sample_size`, default 2: number of solution sets (each containing m solutions) to sample per training problem for diversity. Increasing this introduces more variety in answer combinations but increases training data size linearly.
        - `max_response_length`, default 512. If you are using a thinking model, have a large max_response_length of at least 1024.
    - **LoRA configuration (fixed in code):**
      - rank: 64
      - lora_alpha: 16
      - lora_dropout: 0.1
      - target_modules: `["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"]`
    - **GRPO-specific settings (fixed in code):**
        - group size, default 4: number of generations per GRPO update, same to `train_batch_size`
        - max_prompt_length: 4096
        - warmup_ratio: 0.1
- workflow:
    1. **Training data generation**: For each problem in the dev set, sample `sample_size * m` solutions from the `model_names` solution models (m = number of models). Group them into `sample_size` sets of m solutions each.
    2. **Hard/easy classification**: Evaluate each solution set. A set is "hard" if the majority answer (most frequent) is incorrect; otherwise it's "easy".
    3. **Balanced mixing**: Keep all hard examples and randomly sample an equal number of easy examples (50% by default) to create the final training dataset. This prevents overfitting to either always trusting majority vote or always ignoring it.
    4. **RL training**: Train the aggregator using GRPO with binary rewards (1 if aggregated answer matches ground truth, 0 otherwise) and the aggregation prompt template.
    5. **Inference**: Generate solutions from all solution models on the test set, aggregate them using the trained AggLM, and evaluate performance.
- warning: 
    - Training requires caching all dev set generations (can be large). Cached results are saved in `agglm_log_path` and reused across runs.

    - Outputs: 
      - Trained LoRA adapter: `{agglm_log_path}/{model_filename}/adapter_model.safetensors`

    - `base_model`, default None: the common base model architecture of these LLMs.
    - `fast_merge_flag`, default False: False if they are regular full-size models, True if they are lora adapters.
    - `max_iterations`, default 10: the maximum number of iterations.
    - There are more hyperparameters for particle swarm optimization, please refer to `weight_model_swarms.py`. Only change them if you know what you are doing.

    - `regular_coef`, default 0.05: the coefficient for L1 regularization to prevent weights from becoming too large.
- warning: **All LoRA adapters must share the same base model architecture.** This implementation optimizes based on **generation accuracy**, not likelihood loss. This ensures the metric aligns with the final goal.

#### Weight-level: ExPO (Model Extrapolation)
- file: `weight_expo.py`
- description: Extrapolates model weights as a collaboration strategy. Given n models with the same architecture, evaluates them on the dev set and extrapolates from lower-performing to higher-performing models. Inspired by "Model Extrapolation Expedites Alignment" which showed extrapolation can push models further in beneficial directions.
- related paper(s):

    - `k`, default 1: number of models for top-k/bottom-k mode. Only used when `mode` is `topk_bottomk`.
    - `alpha_mode`, default `fixed`: `fixed` uses the specified alpha directly, `optimized` searches for the best alpha on the dev set.
    - `alpha_candidates`, default `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`: candidate alpha values when `alpha_mode` is `optimized`.
    - `expo_base_path`, default `model_collaboration/logs/expo/`: directory to save intermediate and final extrapolated models.
